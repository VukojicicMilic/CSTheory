<p>
There are multiple definitions of consciousness (Merriam-Webster):
the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself
the state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought: mind:
the element or complex of elements in an individual that feels, perceives, thinks, wills, and mainly reasons&hellip;
</p>


<p>
Two very different ideas/opinions about Mind/Consciousness/AI are coming
 from two significant mathematicians Marvin Minsky and Roger Penrose:
</p>


<p>
Marvin Minsky wrote two very important books about the Mind and the 
complexity of the computer systems and that mind can occur from the 
complexity of the systems:

  <li>The emotion machine (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emotion-Machine-Commonsense-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0743276647">https://www.amazon.com/Emotion-Machine-Commonsense-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0743276647</a>).</li>

</p>


<p>
Roger Penrose also wrote two very important books about his 
argument/reimplementations of G&ouml;del's theorem (Penrose&ndash;Lucas argument) 
and connections with his ideas that from higher complexity and more 
computation Mind cannot occur:

</ol>


<p>
Of course, there are many other very important scientists who have given
 their ideas and answers to some of the questions that are represented 
in the work of Minsky and Penrose:
