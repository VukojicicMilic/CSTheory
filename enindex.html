      <br>



Is this kind of activism taking us to another Unabomber act?<br>



      <br>



The activism that we had in the past months is growing rapidly
throughout the entire world and everyone is trying to have a bite of
this cake.<br>



      <br>



Throwing soup at the problem: are radical climate protests helping or hurting the cause?<br>



      <br>



      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/13/throwing-soup-at-the-problem-are-radical-climate-protests-helping-or-hurting-the-cause">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/13/throwing-soup-at-the-problem-are-radical-climate-protests-helping-or-hurting-the-cause</a><br>



      <br>



If you take a look at the videos that they are recording during this
performance, some of the new "followers" have no idea why are they
doing this kind of act. Also, I witness in Vienna when the activist
glues them to the fossil directly.<br>



      <br>



As much as I support them in the ideological protest against the
climate crisis, I will never support the ideology of following
somebody's ideas and acting like a brainwashed person without knowing
why you are doing that in the first place.<br>



      <br>



My idea is that this kind of behavior will eventually lead us to the
creation of another Unabomber who will be so obsessed with the ideology
that he/she/it proposed. Green anarchism is nothing new we have
Industrial Society and Its Future, or the so-called "Unabomber
Manifesto", where the essay contends that the Industrial Revolution
began a harmful process of natural destruction brought about by
technology.<br>

      <br>



Is this kind of activism that just follows the trend, taking us to another Unabomber idea?<br>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Software as a teaching and learning norm</h3>



Source code is a part of human knowledge, so hiding the source code will be a crime against the learning process and humanity.<br>



      <br>



Schools and teachers need to teach students not just how to use something but how to use it ethically, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> is also covering this category of teaching and learning.<br>



      <br>



Proprietary software represents a secret that forbids users to learn about software that they are using.<br>



      <br>



Proprietary software in school can do much harm:<br>



      <br>



unauthorized access to students' data (images, essays, homework, video, etc...) ;<br>



constant monitoring of students (unnecessary monitoring) ;<br>



creating pressure on using proprietary software (if a school decides to
use proprietary software it is pressuring students to use it also);<br>



using proprietary cloud services ("There is no cloud - only other people's computers");<br>



creating a workflow that supports only proprietary software ;<br>



and much much more...<br>



So, to prevent unjust, not ethical, and overall immoral pressure
teachers and educators should use free software in the educational
process and give their students the freedom that they deserve.<br>

      <br>



The idea of freedom should also be present in the domain of the
hardware itself. For decades we struggle with the idea of freedom in
the terms of software that we are running on our hardware and this idea
developed over the years with the Free Software Foundation, GNU
project, people like Richard Stallman, Eben Moglen, Edward Snowden,
etc. So, we can get freedom in the domain of software, from the
bootloader, drivers, OS, application software, and online application.<br>



      <br>



The main problem that we have now is that some corporations like Intel,
AMD, Apple are making proprietary hardware that can harm the freedom of
the end users. This can be a very big problem becose we cannot see what
is inside of our hardware. Our hardware can do many thing from, having
propriatery hardware in your machine can lead to many things like notn
nowing if hardware itsels is communicating with someone, or if hardware
like your camera is on constntly etc.<br>



      <br>



Richard Stallman take on this ideas:<br>



      <br>



To what extent do the ideas of free software extend to hardware? Is it
a moral obligation to make our hardware designs free, just as it is to
make our software free? Does maintaining our freedom require rejecting
hardware made from nonfree designs?<br>

Also we have other movements like Open Source Hardware Association:<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If we can name all the
proprietary software "Malicious software" we need to be able also to
name all proprietary hardware "Malicious hardware". We need to free our
hardware as well as we have freed our software !<br>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AI, Marx and capitalist economic development</span></h3>



If we look at AI and Big Data we can all agree that we are not all
equal players in this game. Some companies have more data and more
power to train AI systems than the average person in their garage (You
don't need research to deduct this information.). This means that
workers or individuals cannot develop the same products and that the
product of big companies will always be greater than the individual
products of all employees from those companies (employees will not own
the final product). Also, if a company opensource their AI systems they
are often giving the source code of the model or pre-trained systems,
this means that we can not change the AI system itself we can just use
it (the foolish idea that we have/own the final product), it is already
being trained on the data that the company owns (even if the company
release the data we cannot train it on our machine we don't have the
power (CPU/GPU) for the training itself).<br>



      <br>



The problem that we have here is beyond the classical equation for the Surplus value:<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Surplus value (s) = Revenue - production costs (c+v)</span><br>



      <br>



c = constant capital (machinery, materials, fixed costs...).<br>



      <br>



v = variable capital (workers)<br>



      <br>



s = surplus value (surplus of the entrepreneur)<br>



      <br>



or even the exploitation of the working class (employees).<br>



      <br>



The problem is that we are ideologically confused by the idea that we
can "use/own" the final systems and that we can "train" the open-source
systems by ourselves. And this is where Marx shine, we don't own the
production machinery (materialistic view, we don't have the raw power
of CPU/GPU or storage, hardware for the production). And by this
ideology that we have everything that we need to produce the final
value we cannot see the form of exploitation that big companies are
using against all of us.<br>



      <br>



The best way to convince the users that they have the the final
product, is to give them the final product that they cannot create by
themselves (recreate) even if they know how to create it and have all
of the building parts.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">So, we can see that Marx is still relevant in the domain of AI and Big data.</span><br>



      <br>



"AI is a tool of capitalism which transforms our societies within an
environment of technological singularity that helps in the expansion of
the capitalist model of economic development. Such a development
process ensures the precarity of labour."<br>



      <br>



"Nevertheless, the level automation of domestic and workplace tasks and
the machine learning capabilities of the large platform companies will
ensure that the neobourgeoisie will still wield power and influence
despite any attempts by the regulators to reconfigure their value
networks." [1]<br>
